Floating-point value of type 'double' represented as an 'unsigned' fixed-point 'variable' with parameters W = '32', I = '32' (CIN-226)
Floating-point value, represented as an unsigned fixed-point variable with parameters W = '2132', I = '1057', is being cast to type 'double' which has '53' mantissa bits. To avoid platform dependencies the truncation/rounding involved is not supported  (CIN-227)

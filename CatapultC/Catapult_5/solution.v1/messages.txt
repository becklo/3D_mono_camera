Floating-point value (integer bitwidth = '1025' after integer truncation) exceeded range of target 'unsigned' '32'-bit native integer. 'Source Value was not proven to be non-negative' (CIN-229)
Floating-point value of type 'double' represented as a 'signed' fixed-point 'variable' with parameters W = '32', I = '31' (CIN-226)
Floating-point value, represented as an unsigned fixed-point variable with parameters W = '1026', I = '1026', is being cast to type 'double' which has '53' mantissa bits. To avoid platform dependencies the truncation/rounding involved is not supported  (CIN-227)
